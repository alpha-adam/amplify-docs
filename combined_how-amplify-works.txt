AWS Amplify Gen 2 is a TypeScript-based, code-first developer experience for defining backends. It offers a unified Amplify developer experience with hosting, backend, and UI-building capabilities, and a code-first approach. Amplify enables frontend developers to deploy cloud infrastructure by expressing their app's data model, business logic, authentication, and authorization rules in TypeScript. Amplify automatically configures the correct cloud resources, removing the need to manually stitch together underlying AWS services.

You can use Amplify for end-to-end full-stack development. With the Gen 2 developer experience, you can provision backend infrastructure by writing TypeScript code in files following a file-based convention. This approach provides strict typing and IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code, preventing errors. A breaking change in the backend code immediately reflects as a type error in the co-located frontend code.

Amplify also provides faster local development with per-developer cloud sandbox environments. These environments are optimized for faster iterations, allowing each developer to work on full-stack features independently without disrupting others. Additionally, Amplify offers full-stack Git-based environments, where all shared environments map 1:1 to Git branches in your repository. This enables testing of new features in ephemeral environments before merging into production.

The Amplify console provides a single place to manage builds, hosting settings, deployed resources, and environment variables. You can access deployed resources directly in other AWS service consoles, but the Amplify console offers a first-party experience for common app needs like data, authentication, storage, and functions.

To build an app with Amplify, you can start with data. The @aws-amplify/backend library provides a TypeScript-first Data library for setting up fully typed real-time APIs and NoSQL databases. You define your app's data schema in a file like amplify/data/resource.ts, and the defineData function turns the schema into a fully functioning data backend.

For example, a data model for a chat app might look like this:
```typescript
const schema = {
  Chat: {
    name: 'string',
    message: 'hasMany(Message, chatId)',
  },
  Message: {
    text: 'string',
    chat: 'belongsTo(Chat, chatId)',
    chatId: 'id'
  },
};
```
On the frontend, you can use the generateClient function to get a typed client instance, making it easy to integrate CRUD operations into your app code. For example:
```typescript
const client = generateClient<Schema>();
const { data } = await client.models.Message.list();
const { errors, data: newMessage } = await client.models.Message.create({
  text: 'My message text'
});
```
Amplify also provides authentication capabilities. You can configure authentication settings in amplify/auth/resource.ts and customize the sign-in and registration flows, multi-factor authentication, and third-party social providers. Amplify deploys an Amazon Cognito instance when you add authentication to your app.

To add authentication to your React app, you can use the Amplify Authenticator component:
```typescript
import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

function App({ signOut, user }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {user.username}</h1>
      <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default withAuthenticator(App);
```
Amplify makes it easy to build web app user interfaces using the UI component library, Figma-to-code generation, and CRUD form-generation capabilities.

Beyond Amplify, you can connect to any AWS resource using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). The Data and Auth capabilities in @aws-amplify/backend wrap L3 AWS CDK constructs, making it easy to extend the resources generated by Amplify. For example, you can add Amazon Location Services by creating a new file: amplify/custom/maps/resource.ts:
```typescript
import * as locations from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-location';

export class LocationMapStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const map = new locations.CfnMap(this, 'LocationMap', {
      configuration: {
        style: 'VectorEsriStreets' 
      },
      description: 'My Location Map',
      mapName: 'MyMap'
    });

    new CfnOutput(this, 'mapArn', {
      value: map.attrArn,
      exportName: 'mapArn'
    });
  }
}
```
This stack can be included in the amplify/backend.ts file to deploy as part of your Amplify app. Amplify is designed to work with existing AWS resources and configurations, allowing you to adopt its capabilities incrementally into your current workflows.

Is there a way to upgrade an existing Amplify project from Gen 1 to Gen 2?

Amplify is still developing migration tooling to aid in transitioning projects from Gen 1 to Gen 2. Until then, it's recommended to continue working with Gen 1 Amplify projects. A feature support matrix comparing Gen 1 and Gen 2 is available. For new projects, it's recommended to adopt Gen 2 to take advantage of its enhanced capabilities. 

If I have a Gen 1 app, can I use Gen 2 in it?

Amplify Gen 1 and Gen 2 follow different architectural and tooling paradigms. Migration tooling is needed to move from a Gen 1 to Gen 2 app. It's not possible to use Amplify Gen 1 and Gen 2 in the same app.

Should I use Amplify Gen 1 or Gen 2 in new apps?

For new apps, it's recommended to use Amplify Gen 2.

Does Amplify Gen 2 support DataStore?

Amplify Gen 2 supports GraphQL APIs without DataStore. Migration support for moving DataStore Gen 1 apps to Gen 2 will be released.

What programming languages does Amplify Gen 2 support?

Amplify Gen 2 supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Java, Kotlin, and Swift, for client-side development. For backend development, Amplify Gen 2 uses TypeScript.

In Gen 1, Amplify offered a set of use case categories for building applications. Are those same categories available in Gen 2?

Amplify Gen 2 offers built-in support for Auth, Data, Storage, and Functions. Other use cases can be implemented using AWS Cloud Development Kit constructs.

Can I use Gen 2 with a JavaScript frontend that doesn't use TypeScript?

Yes, Amplify Gen 2's TypeScript backend definition works with JavaScript frontends, providing a typed data fetching experience.

What if we want to add a feature like AI/ML or Amazon Location Service to our application in Gen 2?

Any AWS services supported by the AWS CDK can be added to an app using custom resources and L2/L1 AWS CDK constructs.

What happens once my application grows too big and I want to do more configuration with my application?

Amplify is layered on top of the AWS CDK and AWS CloudFormation, allowing the addition of any AWS services supported by CDK to an Amplify app. Configuration of resources can be overridden using the CDK, and any deployment pipeline can be used for more control over CI.

How much does it cost to operate Amplify Gen2?

Pricing information for Amplify is available on the Amplify pricing page.

Which Amplify JavaScript version is compatible with Gen 2?

Amplify JavaScript version 6.2.0 and above is compatible with backends created by Amplify Gen 2. 

Can I use any other database storage other than Amazon DynamoDB? 

Yes, it's possible to use an existing MySQL or PostgreSQL database in an Amplify app. With custom query and mutation support, it's possible to integrate with any existing data source through a Lambda function.
