The AWS Mobile Client and Amplify Android v2 are not compatible with each other. Amplify v2 migrates the credentials from AWS Mobile Client into a different format, leaving AWS Mobile Client unable to read the credentials. If AWS Mobile Client is launched after this migration has taken place, the Amplify v2 credentials will also be cleared.

To use Amplify v2 with the AWS Android SDK, you need to create an AmplifyCredentialsProvider that provides credentials to the AWS Android SDK plugins. This provider uses Amplify Android v2 to provide credentials.

Here is an example of how to create an AmplifyCredentialsProvider in React Native using JavaScript:
```
class AmplifyCredentialsProvider {
  async getCredentials() {
    try {
      const authSession = await Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession();
      const awsCredentials = authSession.getAwsCredentials();
      if (awsCredentials) {
        return {
          accessKeyId: awsCredentials.accessKeyId,
          secretAccessKey: awsCredentials.secretAccessKey,
          sessionToken: awsCredentials.sessionToken,
        };
      } else {
        throw new Error('Failed to get credentials');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Failed to get credentials');
    }
  }

  async refresh() {
    try {
      await Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession({ forceRefresh: true });
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Failed to refresh credentials');
    }
  }
}
```
You can then use this provider with AWS Android SDK plugins that accept an AWSCredentialsProvider.

For example, to use the S3 Storage plugin, you can create a TransferUtility instance like this:
```
const amplifyCredentialsProvider = new AmplifyCredentialsProvider();
const transferUtility = new TransferUtility({
  context: this,
  awsConfiguration: new AWSConfiguration(this),
  s3Client: new AmazonS3Client(amplifyCredentialsProvider, 'us-east-1'),
});
```
Similarly, you can use the IoT plugin like this:
```
const amplifyCredentialsProvider = new AmplifyCredentialsProvider();
const iotClient = new AWSIotClient(amplifyCredentialsProvider);
```
And the Android SDK generated by API Gateway like this:
```
const amplifyCredentialsProvider = new AmplifyCredentialsProvider();
const clientFactory = new ApiClientFactory();
clientFactory.credentialsProvider(amplifyCredentialsProvider);
```
Note that you need to ensure that the resources are in sync between the `amplify_outputs.json` file used by Amplify v2 and the `awsconfiguration.json` file used by the AWS Android SDK. Any manual customizations should be applied to both files.
