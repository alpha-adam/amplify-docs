If you're experiencing missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error messages in your React application, even after calling `Amplify.configure`, it's likely that your Amplify API is being called before `Amplify.configure`. This can happen in several ways, and here are three possible checks to troubleshoot the issue.

First, ensure that `Amplify.configure` is called in the root file of your project. The root file varies depending on your frontend framework. For React, it's usually `src/main.tsx`. Make sure you're calling `Amplify.configure` in this file.

If you're using Next.js App Router, follow the suggestions in the Next.js documentation for root-level configuration. Be aware that if you're calling any APIs at the module-level (i.e., at the top of your file) in any child components, you may still run into this issue.

Second, move any module-level Amplify API invocations. When Amplify APIs are used outside of your application lifecycle, there's a risk that the JavaScript bundler may place that API call before `Amplify.configure`. This can happen when you have code like this:

```tsx
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import ComponentX from 'module-fetch-auth';

Amplify.configure();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
        <ComponentX />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

fetchAuthSession(); // Will throw "AuthUserPoolException: Auth UserPool not configured."

export default function ComponentX() {
  return (
    <div className="box">
     ...
    </div>
  );
}
```

To fix this, move the Amplify API calls to within the application lifecycle. For instance, you can use the `useEffect` hook in React:

```tsx
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import ComponentX from 'module-fetch-auth';

Amplify.configure();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
        <ComponentX />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { type AuthSession, fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function ComponentX() {
  const [session, setSession] = useState<AuthSession|undefined>();

  const getSession = async () => {
    try {
      const currentSession = await fetchAuthSession();
      setSession(currentSession);
    } catch (error: unknown) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getSession();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="box">
     ...
    </div>
  );
}
```

Lastly, if you're working in a multi-page app, you need to call `Amplify.configure()` for each page/route of your application. You can do this by calling `Amplify.configure` in a common source file and importing it into each page. This ensures that Amplify is properly configured for each page in your application.
