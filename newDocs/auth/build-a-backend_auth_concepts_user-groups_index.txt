Amplify Auth provides a mechanism that allows you to group users. Assigning users to groups enables you to customize access for a collection of users, or leverage for auditing purposes. For example, only "ADMINS" users are permitted to delete posts from a bulletin, or only "EDITORS" are permitted to modify posts in a "draft" state. To get started with groups, configure the groups property.

To configure the groups property in a React application, you would need to define your authentication resource. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
const auth = {
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
  },
  groups: ["ADMINS", "EDITORS"],
}
```

Note that there are a few limitations with groups, including a limit of 10,000 groups per user pool.

Amplify resources enable you to define access for groups using common language. For example, you can use `allow.groups` in data. Here's an example of how you can define access for groups in a React application:

```javascript
const schema = {
  Article: {
    authorization: (allow) => [
      allow.groups(["EDITORS"]).to(["read", "update"])
    ]
  }
}
```

Or in storage:

```javascript
const storage = {
  name: "articles",
  access: (allow) => ({
    "drafts/*": [allow.groups(["EDITORS"]).to(["read", "write"])],
  }),
}
```

By defining access with groups, Amplify configures authorization rules to read from the current user's groups. User pool groups are available as a claim in the user's ID token and access token as `cognito:groups`. Requests can be made to secure resources using the access token and validated against this claim to permit action on the resource.

Each Cognito user pool group is assigned an IAM role. IAM roles can be modified to extend access to other AWS resources. Roles can be accessed from your backend on the `role` property of your group. Here's an example of how you can access the role of a group in a React application:

```javascript
const { groups } = auth;
const adminRole = groups["ADMINS"].role;
```

For more information on group roles and how to use them to secure access to your resources, you can refer to the AWS documentation on IAM roles.
