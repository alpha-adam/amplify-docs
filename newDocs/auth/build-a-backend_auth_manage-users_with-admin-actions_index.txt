To manage users with Admin Actions in Amplify Auth, you can use the AWS SDK's `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider` package. This package is intended for server-side use and can be used within a Function. One example of using this package is with the `addUserToGroup` action, which can be defined as a custom mutation.

First, create an "ADMINS" group that will be used to authorize the mutation. This is done by defining authentication settings that include the creation of the "ADMINS" group.

Next, create a Function resource named "add-user-to-group". This function will be used to handle the `addUserToGroup` mutation.

Then, in your authentication resources, grant access for the "add-user-to-group" function to perform the `addUserToGroup` action. This involves specifying the function and the action it is allowed to perform.

After that, define the custom mutation for `addUserToGroup`. This mutation will use the "add-user-to-group" function resource and can only be called by a user in the "ADMINS" group. The mutation takes two arguments: the user ID and the group name.

Finally, create the handler for the "add-user-to-group" function using the AWS SDK's `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider` package. The handler function will add a user to a group using the `AdminAddUserToGroupCommand`.

To use the `addUserToGroup` mutation in your React frontend, you can generate a client using the Amplify data API and then call the mutation with the group name and user ID. Here's an example of how to call the mutation:

```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';

// Initialize Amplify
Amplify.configure({
  // your configuration
});

// Generate the client
const apiName = 'your-api-name';
const api = API.graphql({ apiName });

// Call the mutation
const variables = {
  groupName: 'ADMINS',
  userId: '5468d468-4061-70ed-8870-45c766d26225',
};

const mutation = `
  mutation AddUserToGroup($groupName: String!, $userId: String!) {
    addUserToGroup(groupName: $groupName, userId: $userId)
  }
`;

api.graphql({
  query: mutation,
  variables,
});
```

This will add the specified user to the "ADMINS" group using the `addUserToGroup` mutation.
