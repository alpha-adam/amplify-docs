The quickest way to get started with Amplify Auth in your React application is with the Authenticator component, which provides a customizable UI and complete authentication flows. This component is automatically configured based on the outputs generated from your backend.

To use the Authenticator component in your React application, you can import it from `@aws-amplify/ui-react` and configure Amplify with your backend outputs. Here's an example of how to use the Authenticator component:

```tsx
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';
import outputs from "../amplify_outputs.json";

Amplify.configure(outputs);

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Authenticator>
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
        <main>
          <h1>Hello {user?.username}</h1>
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </main>
      )}
    </Authenticator>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you can bring your own UI and leverage the library from `aws-amplify` to handle authentication flows manually. To learn more about the Authenticator and how to customize its appearance, visit the Amplify UI documentation.
