You can configure Amplify Auth to use an existing Amazon Cognito user pool and identity pool. If you are in a team setting or part of a company that has previously created auth resources, you can configure the client library directly or maintain references with AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) in your Amplify backend. 

When using existing auth resources, you may need to add additional policies or permissions for your authenticated and unauthenticated IAM roles, and these changes must be performed manually.

To use existing resources without an Amplify backend, you can configure the client library directly. For example, in a React application, you can configure Amplify like this:
```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    Cognito: {
      userPoolId: "<your-cognito-user-pool-id>",
      userPoolClientId: "<your-cognito-user-pool-client-id>",
      identityPoolId: "<your-cognito-identity-pool-id>",
      loginWith: {
        email: true,
      },
      signUpVerificationMethod: "code",
      userAttributes: {
        email: {
          required: true,
        },
      },
      allowGuestAccess: true,
      passwordFormat: {
        minLength: 8,
        requireLowercase: true,
        requireUppercase: true,
        requireNumbers: true,
        requireSpecialCharacters: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

If you have created Amazon Cognito resources outside of the context of your Amplify app, you can use `referenceAuth` to reference the existing resources. It requires a user pool, a user pool client, identity pool, and an authenticated and unauthenticated IAM role configured on your identity pool.

To reference existing resources in a React application, you would typically do this in your Amplify backend configuration. For example:
```javascript
import { referenceAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = referenceAuth({
  userPoolId: 'us-east-1_xxxx',
  identityPoolId: 'us-east-1:b57b7c3b-9c95-43e4-9266-xxxx',
  authRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::xxxx:role/amplify-xxxx-mai-amplifyAuthauthenticatedU-xxxx',
  unauthRoleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::xxxx:role/amplify-xxxx-mai-amplifyAuthunauthenticate-xxxx',
  userPoolClientId: 'xxxx',
});
```

The configuration of your referenced resources cannot be modified. However, you can grant permissions to your auth resource from other Amplify backend resources using the `access` property.

You can also reference different sets of auth resources depending on the deployment context by using environment variables. 

Finally, to connect your frontend to the auth resources, you would need to follow the instructions for connecting your frontend, which can be found in the next steps section.
