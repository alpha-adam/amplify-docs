By default, Amplify Auth allows users to sign in using their email address. However, you can change or extend this to also allow users to sign in using their phone number. 

To do this, you need to configure the phone sign-in method in your authentication settings. Here is an example of how to do this in your Amplify Auth configuration:
```javascript
const auth = {
  loginWith: {
    phone: true,
  },
}
```
This configuration will require users to provide a phone number when signing up, and this attribute cannot be changed. 

After setting up phone sign-in, you can use the `signIn` API to allow users to sign in with their phone number. You can also customize the SMS messages sent to users during the sign-in process.
