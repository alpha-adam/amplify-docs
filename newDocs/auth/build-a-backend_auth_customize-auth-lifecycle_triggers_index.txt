You can customize Amplify Auth's behavior using triggers. A trigger is a function that executes during the authentication flow. This allows you to add custom logic, such as validating email domains, adding users to groups, or creating user profiles upon account confirmation.

Triggers are essentially Cognito user pool Lambda triggers. When a Lambda trigger is assigned to your user pool, Amazon Cognito interrupts its default flow and requests information from your function. It generates a JSON event containing user request information, such as creating a user account, signing in, resetting a password, or updating an attribute. Your function can then take action or send the event back unmodified.

To get started with triggers in a React application, you would define a function and specify the triggers property on your auth resource. Here is an example of how to do this in React:

```javascript
import { defineAuth } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
  },
  triggers: {}
});
```
