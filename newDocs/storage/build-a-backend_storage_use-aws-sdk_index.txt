To access the S3Client instance for advanced use cases where Amplify does not provide the functionality, you can retrieve the escape hatch. 

For Android, you would use the following Java or Kotlin code to get the escape hatch. 

In Java:
```java
AWSS3StoragePlugin plugin = (AWSS3StoragePlugin) Amplify.Storage.getPlugin("awsS3StoragePlugin");
S3Client client = plugin.getEscapeHatch();
```
In Kotlin:
```kotlin
val plugin = Amplify.Storage.getPlugin("awsS3StoragePlugin") as AWSS3StoragePlugin
val client = plugin.escapeHatch
```
In React, you would use the following code to get the escape hatch:
```javascript
const plugin = Amplify.Storage.getPlugin('awsS3StoragePlugin');
const client = plugin.getEscapeHatch();
```
For iOS, you would use the following Swift code to get the escape hatch:
```swift
do {
    let plugin = try Amplify.Storage.getPlugin(for: "awsS3StoragePlugin")
    guard let storagePlugin = plugin as? AWSS3StoragePlugin else {
        return
    }
    let s3Client = storagePlugin.getEscapeHatch()
    // Make requests using s3Client...
} catch {
    print("Get escape hatch failed with error - \(error)")
}
```
In React, the equivalent code would be:
```javascript
try {
  const plugin = await Amplify.Storage.getPlugin('awsS3StoragePlugin');
  const s3Client = plugin.getEscapeHatch();
  // Make requests using s3Client...
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Get escape hatch failed with error - ', error);
}
```
