Files can be removed from a storage bucket using the remove API. If a file is protected by an identity Id, only the user who owns the file will be able to remove it.

You can perform a remove operation from a specific bucket by providing the target bucket's assigned name from Amplify Backend in the bucket option. 

```javascript
import { remove } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

try {
  await remove({ 
    path: 'album/2024/1.jpg',
    bucket: 'assignedNameInAmplifyBackend', 
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Error ', error);
}
```

Alternatively, you can also pass in an object by specifying the bucket name and region from the console.

```javascript
import { remove } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

try {
  await remove({ 
    path: 'album/2024/1.jpg',
    bucket: {
      bucketName: 'bucket-name-from-console',
      region: 'us-east-2'
    }
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Error ', error);
}
```

There are additional options that can be used with the remove API. 

Option | Type | Default | Description 
| -- | :--: | :--: | ----------- 
| bucket | string or { bucketName: string; region: string; } | Default bucket and region from Amplify configuration | A string representing the target bucket's assigned name in Amplify Backend or an object specifying the bucket name and region from the console.
| expectedBucketOwner | string | Optional | The account ID that owns requested bucket. 

Note: The account ID of the owner of the bucket is required when removing objects from a bucket that is not owned by the account that is making the request.
