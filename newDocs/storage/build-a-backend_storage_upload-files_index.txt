You can implement upload functionality in your app by either using the File Uploader UI component or further customizing the upload experience using the upload API.

To use the File Uploader UI component, you need to install the required packages by running the command `npm add @aws-amplify/ui-react-storage aws-amplify` in your terminal. Then, you can use the component in your app like this:

```tsx
import { FileUploader } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

export const DefaultFileUploaderExample = () => {
  return (
    <FileUploader
      acceptedFileTypes={['image/*']}
      path="public/"
      maxFileCount={1}
      isResumable
    />
  );
};
```

To implement upload functionality using the upload API, you can use the `uploadData` function from the `aws-amplify/storage` module. Here's an example of how to upload a file from a file object:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { uploadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

function App() {
  const [file, setFile] = React.useState();

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setFile(event.target.files?.[0]);
  };

  const handleClick = () => {
    if (!file) {
      return;
    }
    uploadData({
      path: `photos/${file.name}`,
      data: file,
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleChange} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Upload</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can also upload data from a data object. Here's an example:

```javascript
import { uploadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

try {
  const result = await uploadData({
    path: "album/2024/1.jpg",
    data: file,
  }).result;
  console.log('Succeeded: ', result);
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Error : ', error);
}
```

Additionally, you can monitor the progress of an upload by using the `onProgress` option. Here's an example:

```javascript
import { uploadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

const monitorUpload = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await uploadData({
      path: "album/2024/1.jpg",
      data: file,
      options: {
        onProgress: ({ transferredBytes, totalBytes }) => {
          if (totalBytes) {
            console.log(
              `Upload progress ${Math.round(
                (transferredBytes / totalBytes) * 100
              )} %`
            );
          }
        },
      },
    }).result;
    console.log("Path from Response: ", result.path);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error : ", error);
  }
}
```

You can also pause, resume, and cancel uploads using the `pause`, `resume`, and `cancel` methods.

```javascript
import { uploadData, isCancelError } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

const uploadTask = uploadData({ path, data: file });
uploadTask.pause();
uploadTask.resume();
uploadTask.cancel();
try {
  await uploadTask.result;
} catch (error) {
  if (isCancelError(error)) {
    console.log("Upload was cancelled");
  }
}
```

You can customize the behavior of `uploadData` and the properties of the uploaded object by passing in additional options. Here are some of the available options:

* `bucket`: a string representing the target bucket's assigned name in Amplify Backend or an object specifying the bucket name and region from the console.
* `contentType`: the default content-type header value of the file when downloading it.
* `contentEncoding`: the default content-encoding header value of the file when downloading it.
* `contentDisposition`: specifies presentational information for the object.
* `metadata`: a map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
* `useAccelerateEndpoint`: whether to use accelerate endpoint.
* `expectedBucketOwner`: the account ID that owns the requested bucket.
* `preventOverwrite`: whether to check if an object with the same key already exists before completing the upload.
* `checksumAlgorithm`: whether to compute the checksum for the data to be uploaded, so the S3 can verify the data integrity.

Note that uploads that were initiated over one hour ago will be cancelled automatically. It is recommended to setup a S3 lifecycle rule to automatically cleanup incomplete upload requests.
