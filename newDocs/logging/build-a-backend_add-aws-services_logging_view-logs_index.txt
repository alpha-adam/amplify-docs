To view logs in Amazon CloudWatch, you need to access the log group that you created and specified during the initial setup. Each user's log messages are stored in a user-specific log stream within the log group. The log stream names are generated based on the user's device identifier and user identifier.

For authenticated users, the log stream name is a combination of the device identifier and user identifier, separated by a period. For unauthenticated users, the log stream name is a combination of the device identifier and the string "guest".

You can use the Amplify Auth category to retrieve the user identifier for a specific user if needed. Alternatively, you can retrieve the user identifier by visiting the Amazon Cognito console and inspecting the User ID in User pools.

To access your logs in the AWS Console, follow these steps:
1. Log into the AWS Console.
2. Navigate to Amazon CloudWatch.
3. In the left navigation panel, click on Logs and then click on Log groups.
4. Enter your log group name in the Filter field.
5. Click on your log group in the filtered results to view all log streams. 

In a React application using AWS Amplify, you would use the `Auth` category from `@aws-amplify/auth` to retrieve the user identifier. For example:
```javascript
import { Auth } from '@aws-amplify/auth';

Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser().then((user) => {
  const userId = user.username;
  // Use the user ID to construct the log stream name
});
```
