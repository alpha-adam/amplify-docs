To validate user attributes with an Auth trigger in AWS Amplify Gen 2, you can create a Cognito pre sign-up Lambda trigger. This trigger extends the sign-up behavior to validate attribute values. 

To get started, create a new function that will act as the pre sign-up trigger. In a React application, you can define this function using `defineFunction` from `@aws-amplify/backend`. 

For example, you can create a file called `preSignUp.js` with the following contents:
```javascript
import { defineFunction } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const preSignUp = defineFunction({
  name: "pre-sign-up",
  resourceGroupName: 'auth'
});
```

Next, create a corresponding handler file called `handler.js` with the following contents:
```javascript
function isOlderThan(date, age) {
  const comparison = new Date()
  comparison.setFullYear(comparison.getFullYear() - age)
  return date.getTime() > comparison.getTime()
}

export const handler = async (event) => {
  const birthdate = new Date(event.request.userAttributes["birthdate"])

  // you must be 13 years or older
  if (!isOlderThan(birthdate, 13)) {
    throw new Error("You must be 13 years or older to use this site")
  }

  return event
}
```

Lastly, set the newly created function resource on your auth resource. In a React application, you can do this by importing `defineAuth` from `@aws-amplify/backend` and setting the `triggers` property. For example:
```javascript
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { preSignUp } from './preSignUp';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  //...
  triggers: {
    preSignUp
  }
});
```

After deploying the changes, whenever a user attempts to sign up, this handler will verify that the submitter's age is above 13 years.
