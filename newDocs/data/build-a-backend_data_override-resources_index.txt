You can modify the underlying AWS resources generated by the Amplify GraphQL API to optimize the deployed stack for your specific use case. Amplify uses a variety of auto-generated AWS services and resources, and you can customize these resources using CDK constructs.

To access the underlying resources, you can use CDK "L2" or "L1" constructs. You can access the generated resources as L2 constructs via the `.resources` property on the returned stack or access the generated resources as L1 constructs using the `.resources.cfnResources` property.

For example, to modify the resources, you can use the following code:
```typescript
const { cfnResources } = backend.data.resources;
```
You can then customize the resources, such as enabling X-Ray tracing for the AppSync GraphQL API:
```typescript
cfnResources.cfnGraphqlApi.xrayEnabled = true;
```
You can also modify the resources generated for specific data models, such as enabling time-to-live on a DynamoDB table:
```typescript
cfnResources.amplifyDynamoDbTables["Todo"].timeToLiveAttribute = {
  attributeName: "ttl",
  enabled: true,
};
```
Additionally, you can configure various settings for DynamoDB tables, such as:
* Billing mode: `cfnResources.amplifyDynamoDbTables['Todo'].billingMode = BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST;`
* Provisioned throughput: `cfnResources.amplifyDynamoDbTables["Todo"].provisionedThroughput = { readCapacityUnits: 5, writeCapacityUnits: 5 };`
* Point-in-time recovery: `cfnResources.amplifyDynamoDbTables['Todo'].pointInTimeRecoveryEnabled = true;`

These are just a few examples of how you can customize the underlying AWS resources generated by the Amplify GraphQL API.
