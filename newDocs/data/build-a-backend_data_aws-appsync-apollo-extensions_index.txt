AWS AppSync Apollo Extensions provide a seamless way to connect to your AWS AppSync backend using Apollo client, an open-source GraphQL client. 

To learn more about Apollo, see https://www.apollographql.com/docs/. 

## Features

AWS AppSync Apollo Extensions provide AWS AppSync authorizers to be used with the Apollo client to make it simple to apply the correct authorization payloads to your GraphQL operations.

Additionally, the included Amplify components allow Amplify to provide auth tokens and signing logic for the corresponding Authorizers.

## Install the AWS AppSync Apollo Extensions library

To install the library in a React application, you can use npm or yarn to add the `apollo-appsync-amplify` dependency. 

```bash
npm install apollo-appsync-amplify
```

or 

```bash
yarn add apollo-appsync-amplify
```

Alternatively, if you are not using Amplify, you can install the `apollo-appsync` dependency.

```bash
npm install apollo-appsync
```

or 

```bash
yarn add apollo-appsync
```

## Connecting to AWS AppSync with Apollo client

To connect to AWS AppSync with Apollo client in a React application, you need to create an Apollo client instance and pass it to the ApolloProvider component.

Here is an example of how you can create an Apollo client instance:

```javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { AppSyncAuthTransformer } from 'apollo-appsync-amplify';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://your-appsync-endpoint.com/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  transformResponse: AppSyncAuthTransformer,
});
```

You can then pass the client to the ApolloProvider component:

```javascript
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

function App() {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      // your application code here
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
}
```

## Providing AppSync Authorizers

To provide AppSync authorizers, you need to create an instance of the AppSyncAuth class and pass it to the Apollo client.

Here is an example of how you can create an AppSyncAuth instance:

```javascript
import { AppSyncAuth } from 'apollo-appsync-amplify';

const appSyncAuth = new AppSyncAuth({
  apikey: 'your-api-key',
});
```

You can then pass the appSyncAuth instance to the Apollo client:

```javascript
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://your-appsync-endpoint.com/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  transformResponse: AppSyncAuthTransformer,
  auth: appSyncAuth,
});
```

## Connecting Amplify Data to Apollo client

To connect Amplify Data to Apollo client, you need to create an instance of the AmplifyAuth class and pass it to the Apollo client.

Here is an example of how you can create an AmplifyAuth instance:

```javascript
import { AmplifyAuth } from 'aws-amplify';

const amplifyAuth = new AmplifyAuth({
  // your amplify configuration here
});
```

You can then pass the amplifyAuth instance to the Apollo client:

```javascript
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://your-appsync-endpoint.com/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  transformResponse: AppSyncAuthTransformer,
  auth: amplifyAuth,
});
```

## Downloading the AWS AppSync schema

To download the AWS AppSync schema, you can use the AWS AppSync console or the Amplify CLI.

Here is an example of how you can download the schema using the Amplify CLI:

```bash
amplify pull --schema
```

This will download the schema and save it to a file named `schema.json`.

## Generating Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions for Apollo client

To generate queries, mutations, and subscriptions for Apollo client, you can use the Amplify CLI.

Here is an example of how you can generate queries, mutations, and subscriptions using the Amplify CLI:

```bash
amplify codegen --graphql
```

This will generate the queries, mutations, and subscriptions based on your schema and save them to a file named `graphql.ts`.

## Connecting to AWS AppSync real-time endpoint

To connect to the AWS AppSync real-time endpoint, you need to create an instance of the AppSyncRealTimeClient class and pass it to the Apollo client.

Here is an example of how you can create an AppSyncRealTimeClient instance:

```javascript
import { AppSyncRealTimeClient } from 'apollo-appsync-amplify';

const realTimeClient = new AppSyncRealTimeClient({
  endpoint: 'https://your-appsync-endpoint.com/graphql',
  auth: appSyncAuth,
});
```

You can then pass the realTimeClient instance to the Apollo client:

```javascript
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://your-appsync-endpoint.com/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  transformResponse: AppSyncAuthTransformer,
  realTime: realTimeClient,
});
```

Note: The above examples are for React applications, and you may need to adjust them according to your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to replace the placeholders (e.g. `https://your-appsync-endpoint.com/graphql`) with your actual AWS AppSync endpoint and credentials.
