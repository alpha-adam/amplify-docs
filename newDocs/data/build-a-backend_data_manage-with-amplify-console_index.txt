The Data manager page in the Amplify Console is a user-friendly interface for managing the backend GraphQL API data of an application. It allows you to create and update application data in real-time, eliminating the need to build separate admin views.

To use the Data manager, you need to have already created a data resource. If you haven't, you can visit the Data setup guide to get started.

To access the Data manager, follow these steps:
1. Log in to the Amplify console and choose your app.
2. Select the branch you want to access.
3. Select Data from the left navigation bar.
4. Then, select Data manager.

Once you're on the Data manager page, you can perform various actions:
- To create a record, select a table from the dropdown, click Create, enter your custom values, and submit.
- To update a record, select a table, choose a record, make changes, and submit.
- To delete a record(s), select a table, choose the record(s), and select delete item(s) from the Actions dropdown.
- To seed records, select a table, choose Auto-generate data from the Actions dropdown, specify the number of rows and constraints, and generate data. Note that you can generate up to 100 records at a time, but this feature is not available for tables with certain field types.
- To download records, select a table, choose an option from the Actions dropdown (Download selected items or Download all items), and your data will be downloaded as a CSV file.
