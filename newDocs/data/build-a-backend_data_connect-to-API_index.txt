To connect your React application code to a backend API using the Amplify Libraries, you need to have a cloud sandbox with an Amplify Data resource up and running, a frontend application set up with the Amplify library installed, and npm installed.

First, configure the Amplify Library by adding the following code to your app's entry point to initialize and configure the Amplify client library:
```typescript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import outputs from '../amplify_outputs.json';

Amplify.configure(outputs);
```

Next, generate a "Data client" for your frontend code to make fully-typed API requests to your backend. To do this, use the following code:
```typescript
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import type { Schema } from '../amplify/data/resource';

const client = generateClient<Schema>();
```

You can now use the Data client to make CRUDL operations. For example, to fetch a list of todos, you can use the following code:
```typescript
const fetchTodos = async () => {
  const { data: todos, errors } = await client.models.Todo.list();
};
```

To configure authorization mode, you need to determine how a request should be authorized with the backend. Amplify Data uses the "userPool" authorization by default, which uses the signed-in user credentials to sign an API request. If you use a `allow.publicApiKey()` authorization rule for your data models, you need to use "apiKey" as an authorization mode.

You can set the authorization mode on a per-client basis by specifying the `authMode` parameter on the `generateClient` function. For example:
```typescript
const client = generateClient<Schema>({
  authMode: 'apiKey',
});
```

Alternatively, you can set the authorization mode on each individual API request. For example:
```typescript
const { data: todos, errors } = await client.models.Todo.list({
  authMode: 'apiKey',
});
```

You can also set custom request headers for authorization purposes or to pass additional metadata from your frontend to the backend API. To do this, you can specify a `headers` parameter in the configuration. For example:
```typescript
const client = generateClient<Schema>({
  headers: {
    'My-Custom-Header': 'my value',
  },
});
```

If you have an additional Data endpoint that you're managing with a different Amplify project or through other means, you can utilize that endpoint in your frontend code by specifying the `endpoint` parameter on the `generateClient` function. For example:
```typescript
const client = generateClient({
  endpoint: 'https://my-other-endpoint.com/graphql',
});
```
