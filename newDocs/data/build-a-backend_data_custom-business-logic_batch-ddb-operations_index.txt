Batch DynamoDB operations allow you to add multiple items in a single mutation.

To perform batch operations, you first need to define a custom mutation. This involves defining a return type as a custom type or model, and then defining the mutation itself with the return type and any optional arguments.

For example, let's say we want to create a custom mutation called `BatchCreatePost` that accepts an array of post contents and returns an array of post objects. In React, this can be achieved by defining a schema using the `@aws-amplify/backend` module.

Next, we need to configure a custom business logic handler code for our mutation. This involves defining a custom handler using the `a.handler.custom` function and specifying the data source and entry point for the handler.

The handler code itself will be responsible for mapping the request to the data source's input parameters and then mapping the data source's response back to the query or mutation's return type. Amplify provides a `stash` object that contains useful information such as the AppSync API ID and Amplify API environment name, which can be used to construct the DynamoDB table name.

Finally, once our custom mutation is defined and configured, we can invoke it from our React application using the generated Data client. We can pass in the required arguments, such as an array of post contents, and receive an array of post objects in response.

Here's an example of how we might invoke the `BatchCreatePost` mutation from our React application:
```javascript
const { data, errors } = await client.mutations.BatchCreatePost({
  contents: ['Post 1', 'Post 2', 'Post 3']
});
```
This code will create three new posts in our DynamoDB table with the specified contents and return an array of post objects.
