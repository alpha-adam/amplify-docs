To set up Amplify Geo, you need to create a Geo resource powered by Amazon Location Services. You can use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to create the resource. 

First, you need to install the necessary dependencies, including `aws-amplify` and `@aws-amplify/geo`. You can do this by running the command `npm add aws-amplify @aws-amplify/geo` in your terminal.

Next, you need to import and load the configuration file in your app. You can do this by adding the following code to your app's root entry point:
```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import outputs from '../amplify_outputs.json';
Amplify.configure(outputs);
```
If you are using Next.js, you need to add the following code to your `pages/_app.js` file instead:
```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import outputs from '@/amplify_outputs.json';
Amplify.configure(outputs);
```
Make sure to call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your application's life cycle.

To initialize Amplify Geo, you need to add the AWS Location Geo plugin to your app. You can do this by using the `Amplify.addPlugin` method.

To display a map in your application, you can use the Amplify React MapView component or the MapLibre GL library with the `maplibre-gl-js-amplify` library.

Note that the Geo plugin has a dependency on Cognito Auth, so you need to install and configure Cognito Auth as well.

For Android and iOS, you need to install the Amplify Libraries and initialize Amplify Geo using the `Amplify.addPlugin` method.

If you want to use existing Amazon Location Service resources, you can follow a different guide. If you want to use Amazon Location Service APIs not directly supported by Geo, you can use the escape hatch to access the Amazon Location Service SDK.

The pricing plan for the Map example is set to `RequestBasedUsage`. You should review the location service pricing and terms to learn more about the pricing plan. 

Here is an example of how to create a map using the Amplify MapView component:
```javascript
import { MapView } from '@aws-amplify/geo';

const MyMap = () => {
  return (
    <MapView
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        height: '100%',
        width: '100%',
      }}
    />
  );
};
```
This will render a map in your application. You can customize the map by using various props and methods provided by the MapView component.
