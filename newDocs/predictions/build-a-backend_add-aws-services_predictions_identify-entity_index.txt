To identify entities from images using Amplify, you need to use the `Predictions.identify` function. This function detects entities from an image and potentially related information such as position, faces, and landmarks. It can also identify celebrities and entities that were previously added.

Before you start, make sure to complete the getting started section where you set up the IAM roles with the right policy actions.

The `Predictions.identify` function returns a Promise that resolves to an object with the entities that were identified. The input can be sent directly from the browser using a File object or an ArrayBuffer object, or an Amazon S3 key from a project bucket.

Here are some examples of how to use the `Predictions.identify` function:

Detect entities directly from an image uploaded from the browser:
```javascript
const response = await Predictions.identify({
  entities: {
    source: {
      file,
    },
  }
});
```

Detect entities directly from an image binary from the browser:
```javascript
const response = await Predictions.identify({
  entities: {
    source: {
      bytes: imageArrayBuffer,
    },
  }
});
```

Detect entities from an Amazon S3 key:
```javascript
const response = await Predictions.identify({
  entities: {
    source: {
      key: pathToPhoto,
      level: 'guest' | 'private' | 'protected', 
    },
  }
});
```

You can also detect the bounding box of faces from an image with its landmarks:
```javascript
const { entities } = await Predictions.identify({
  entities: {
    source: {
      file,
    },
  }
})
for (const { boundingBox, landmarks } of entities) {
  const { 
    width, 
    height, 
    left, 
    top 
  } = boundingBox;
  
  for (const landmark of landmarks) {
    const {
      type, 
      x, 
      y 
    } = landmark;
  }
}
```

To detect celebrities on an image, you can use the `celebrityDetection` option:
```javascript
const { entities } = await Predictions.identify({
  entities: {
    source: {
      file,
    },
    celebrityDetection: true 
  }
})

for (const { boundingBox, landmarks, metadata } of entities) {
  const { 
    name,
    urls 
  } = metadata; 
  
  //...
}
```

You can also detect entities from previously uploaded images:
```javascript
const { entities } = await Predictions.identify({
  entities: {
    source: {
      file,
    },
    collection: true
  }
})

for (const { boundingBox, metadata } of entities) {
  const {
    width, 
    height, 
    left, 
    top 
  } = boundingBox;
  const { externalImageId } = metadata; 
}
```
