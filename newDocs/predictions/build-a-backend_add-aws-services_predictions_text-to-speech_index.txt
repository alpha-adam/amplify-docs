To integrate text-to-speech capabilities into your React application using AWS Amplify, start by setting up the necessary IAM roles with the right policy actions as described in the getting started section. 

Once set up, you can use the Predictions API to generate an audio buffer for playback from a text input. You do this by calling the convert method on the Predictions object, passing in an object with the textToSpeech property. This property should contain a source object with the text you want to generate speech from, and a voiceId which specifies the voice to use. 

For example, you can use the following code to generate speech from a text input:
```javascript
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const textToGenerateSpeech = 'Hello, world!';
const result = await Predictions.convert({
  textToSpeech: {
    source: {
      text: textToGenerateSpeech
    },
    voiceId: "Amy" 
  }
})
```
The voiceId should be one of the voices supported by Amazon Polly, such as "Amy". You can find the complete list of voiceId options in the Amazon Polly documentation.
