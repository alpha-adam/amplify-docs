To transcribe audio to text, also known as speech-to-text, in your React application using AWS Amplify, you need to have completed the getting started section first, where you set up the IAM roles with the right policy actions.

You can use the Predictions API to transcribe a PCM audio byte buffer to text, such as a recording from a microphone. 
```javascript
const { Predictions } = require('@aws-amplify/predictions');
const transcription = await Predictions.convert({
  transcription: {
    source: {
      bytes: // your audio byte buffer
    }
  }
})
```
The language data input type must support streaming for it to work with Amplify Predictions. For a complete list of supported languages and language-specific features, refer to the AWS Transcribe documentation.
