Data extraction allows you to parse unstructured text and extract structured data using artificial intelligence. This is useful for converting free-form text into typed objects that can be used in your application.

The following example shows how to extract product details from an unstructured product description in a React application. The AI model will analyze the text and return a structured object containing the product name, summary, price, and category.

To achieve this, you need to define a schema that includes a custom type for the product details and a generation that uses the AI model to extract the details. 

In your React component, you can use the `useAIGeneration` hook from `@aws-amplify/ui-react-ai` to generate the product details. This hook returns a function to extract the product details and a state object with the generated data and a loading indicator.

Here is an example of how to use it:
```javascript
import { generateClient } from "aws-amplify/api";
import { createAIHooks } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react-ai";

const client = generateClient({ authMode: "userPool" });
const { useAIGeneration } = createAIHooks(client);

function Example() {
  const productDescription = `The NBA Official Game Basketball is a premium
  regulation-size basketball crafted with genuine leather and featuring
  official NBA specifications. This professional-grade ball offers superior grip
  and durability, with deep channels and a moisture-wicking surface that ensures
  consistent performance during intense game play. Priced at $159.99, this high-end
  basketball belongs in our Professional Sports Equipment category and is the same model
  used in NBA games.`

  const [{ data, isLoading }, extractProductDetails] =
    useAIGeneration("extractProductDetails");

  const productDetails = async () => {
    extractProductDetails({
      productDescription
    });
  };
}
```

When you call the `extractProductDetails` function, it will generate the product details and update the `data` state with the result. The response will be a structured object containing the product name, summary, price, and category, like this:
```json
{
  "name": "NBA Official Game Basketball",
  "summary": "Premium regulation-size NBA basketball made with genuine leather. Features official NBA specifications, superior grip, deep channels, and moisture-wicking surface for consistent game play performance.",
  "price": 159.99,
  "category": "Professional Sports Equipment"
}
```
