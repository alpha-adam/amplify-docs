To interact with bots in your React application using AWS Amplify, you can send messages to the chatbot backend using the send command. This method returns a promise that includes the chatbot response. 

To send a message, provide a bot name and user input. For example, if a user wants to reserve a hotel for tonight, you can send this input to the chatbot and log the response. 

Here is an example of how to send a message to a bot in React:
```javascript
const userInput = "I want to reserve a hotel for tonight";
const response = await Interactions.send({
  botName: "TheBotName",
  message: userInput
});
console.log(response.message);
```

You can also display an end of chat message by registering a function to catch errors or chatbot confirmations when the session successfully ends. This can be done using the onComplete method. 

Here is an example of how to display an end of chat message in React:
```javascript
Interactions.onComplete({
  botName: "TheBotName",
  callback: (error, completion) => {
    if (error) {
      alert('bot conversation failed');
    } else if (completion) {
      console.debug('done: ' + JSON.stringify(completion, null, 2));
      alert('Trip booked. Thank you! What would you like to do next?');
    }
  }
});
```
