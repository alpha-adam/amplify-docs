Amazon Personalize can create recommendations by using event data, historical data, or a combination of both. The event data can then be used to create recommendations.

To record event data, you need the following:
* A dataset group
* An event tracker

For more information, see Record Events.

After creating the Amazon Personalize dataset group, you need to add the personalize:PutEvents permission to your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user roles. An example IAM policy is:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "personalize:PutEvents",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:personalize:<your-aws-region>:<your-account-id>:event-tracker/<your-resource-name>"
  }]
}
```
You need the tracking ID of your event tracker. 

Configure Amazon Personalize in your React application:
```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
Amplify.configure({
  Analytics: {
    Personalize: {
      trackingId: '<tracking-id>',
      region: 'us-east-1',
      flushSize: 10,
      flushInterval: 5000 
    }
  }
});
```
You can use the Identify event type to track a user identity by specifying a unique identifier for the userId property. Consider recording Identify events after a user registers, logs in, updates their information, or loads pages accessible by a logged-in user.
```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

record({
  eventType: 'Identify',
  properties: {
    userId: '<user-id>'
  }
});
```
You can send events to Amazon Personalize by calling the record operation. If you already use Identify to track end-user data, you can skip the userId.
```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

record({
  eventType: '<event-type>',
  properties: {
    itemId: '<item-id>',
    eventValue: '<event-value>'
  }
});
```
You can track iframe and HTML5 media types by using the MediaAutoTrack event type.
```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

record({
  eventType: 'MediaAutoTrack',
  properties: {
    domElementId: 'media-dom-element-id',
    itemId: '<item-d>'
  }
});
```
The recorded events are saved in a buffer and sent to the remote server periodically. If needed, you have the option to manually clear all the events from the buffer by using the flushEvents API.
```javascript
import { flushEvents } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

flushEvents();
```
