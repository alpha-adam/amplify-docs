The Amazon Data Firehose analytics provider allows you to send analytics data to an Amazon Data Firehose stream for reliably storing data. 

To set up a Firehose stream, you need to create a storage bucket to store the data from the Firehose stream and then create the Firehose resource. 

You can use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to create the Analytics resource powered by Amazon Data Firehose. 

First, create a storage bucket to store the data from the Firehose stream. 

Then, create the Firehose resource. You need to create a new IAM role for the Firehose, grant the Firehose role read/write permissions to the S3 bucket, and create a new Firehose delivery stream. 

You also need to create a new IAM policy to allow users to write to the Firehose and attach the policy to the authenticated and unauthenticated IAM roles. 

To install and configure the Firehose, ensure you have set up IAM permissions for firehose:PutRecordBatch. 

Here is an example IAM policy for Amazon Data Firehose:

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "firehose:PutRecordBatch",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:firehose:<your-aws-region>:<your-aws-account-id>:deliverystream/<your-stream-name>"
  }]
}
```

Configure Firehose by importing Amplify from 'aws-amplify' and calling Amplify.configure with the Analytics configuration:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Analytics: {
    KinesisFirehose: {
      region: 'us-east-1',
      bufferSize: 1000,
      flushSize: 100,
      flushInterval: 5000,
      resendLimit: 5
    }
  }
});
```

To store data, you can send data to a Firehose stream with the standard record method:

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/kinesis-firehose';

record({
  data: {
    // The data blob to put into the record
  },
  streamName: 'myFirehose'
});
```

You can also manually clear all the events from the buffer by using the 'flushEvents' API:

```javascript
import { flushEvents } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/kinesis-firehose';

flushEvents();
```
