Amplify allows you to interact with In-App Messaging APIs, which enables you to send messages to your app users. In-App Messaging is a powerful tool to engage with your users and provide them with relevant information. 

A campaign is a messaging initiative that engages a specific audience segment. A campaign sends tailored messages according to a schedule that you define. You can use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to create a campaign that sends messages through any single channel that is supported by Amazon Pinpoint, such as Mobile Push, In-App, Email, SMS, or Custom channels.

To create an In-App Messaging resource, you can use the AWS CDK. Note that there are no official hand-written constructs for this service yet. 

When creating a campaign, the start time must be at least 15 minutes in the future. In-app messages can only be synced to the local device once the campaign becomes active, which is indicated by a "Status" of "In Progress" in the campaigns screen of the Pinpoint console.

Here's an example of how to create an In-App Messaging resource using the AWS CDK. This example creates a Pinpoint app, a segment, and a campaign with an event and in-app message template.

To create a Pinpoint app, segment, and campaign in React, you can use the following code:
```javascript
import { defineBackend } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { auth } from "./auth/resource";
import { data } from "./data/resource";
import {
  CfnApp,
  CfnCampaign,
  CfnSegment,
} from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-pinpoint";
import { Policy, PolicyStatement } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam";
import { Stack } from "aws-cdk-lib/core";

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth, 
  data,
});

const inAppMessagingStack = backend.createStack("inAppMessaging-stack");

// create a Pinpoint app
const pinpoint = new CfnApp(inAppMessagingStack, "Pinpoint", {
  name: "myPinpointApp",
});

// create a segment 
const mySegment = new CfnSegment(inAppMessagingStack, "Segment", {
  applicationId: pinpoint.ref,
  name: "mySegment",
});

// create a campaign with event and in-app message template
new CfnCampaign(inAppMessagingStack, "Campaign", {
  applicationId: pinpoint.ref,
  name: "MyCampaign",
  segmentId: mySegment.attrSegmentId,
  schedule: {
    startTime: "2024-02-23T14:39:34Z", 
    endTime: "2024-02-29T14:32:40Z",
    frequency: "IN_APP_EVENT",
    eventFilter: {
      dimensions: {
        eventType: {
          dimensionType: "INCLUSIVE",
          values: ["my_first_event"],
        },
      },
      filterType: "ENDPOINT",
    },
  },

  messageConfiguration: {
    inAppMessage: {
      layout: "TOP_BANNER",
      content: [
        {
          bodyConfig: {
            alignment: "CENTER",
            body: "This is an example in-app message.",
            textColor: "#FFFFFF",
          },
          backgroundColor: "#000000",
          headerConfig: {
            alignment: "CENTER",
            header: "Welcome!",
            textColor: "#FFFFFF",
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

To install Amplify libraries, you need to first install the `aws-amplify` library. 

To initialize In-App Messaging, you need to configure your application using the `configure` API and then initialize In-App Messaging by calling the `initializeInAppMessaging` API. 

Here's how to initialize In-App Messaging in a React application:
```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { initializeInAppMessaging } from 'aws-amplify/in-app-messaging';
import outputs from '../amplify_outputs.json';

Amplify.configure(outputs);
initializeInAppMessaging();
```

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your applicationâ€™s life-cycle to avoid any missing configuration or `NoCredentials` errors.
