To delete data using the Delete API in AWS Amplify, you can make a DELETE request to the API endpoint. 

In React, you can use the `del` function from `aws-amplify/api` to send a DELETE request. Here's an example:
```javascript
import { del } from 'aws-amplify/api';

async function deleteItem() {
  try {
    const restOperation = del({
      apiName: 'myRestApi',
      path: 'items/1'
    });
    await restOperation.response;
    console.log('DELETE call succeeded');
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('DELETE call failed: ', JSON.parse(e.response.body));
  }
}
```
This code sends a DELETE request to the `myRestApi` API at the `items/1` path. If the request is successful, it logs 'DELETE call succeeded' to the console. If the request fails, it logs the error response to the console.
