To set up your platform for Amplify, follow these steps for each operating system:

For iOS, make sure you have a minimum deployment target of 13.0 and Xcode 15.0 or higher. To do this, update the target iOS platform in your `ios/Podfile` to 13.0 or higher. Then, open your project in Xcode, select the Runner target, and update the "Minimum Deployments" section to 13.0 or higher. Also, update the "iOS Deployment Target" to 13.0 or higher.

For Android, Amplify supports API level 24+ (Android 7.0+), and requires Gradle 8+, Kotlin 1.9+, and Java 17+. To set this up, update the Android Gradle plugin and kotlin versions in your `android/settings.gradle` file. Then, update the Gradle `distributionUrl` in your `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file. Next, update the Java version and minimum Android SDK version in your `android/app/build.gradle` file. Additionally, you need to add the internet permission to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file to make network requests in release mode.

For web, there are no Amplify specific requirements or setup instructions. You just need to use a browser supported by Flutter.

For macOS, Amplify requires a minimum deployment target of 10.15 and Xcode 15.0 or higher. Update the target macOS platform in your `macos/Podfile` to 10.15 or higher. Then, open your project in Xcode, select the Runner target, and update the "Minimum Deployments" section to 10.15 or higher. Also, update the "macOS Deployment Target" to 10.15 or higher. You also need to enable networking and keychain entitlements in the "Signing and Capabilities" tab.

For Windows, there are no Amplify specific requirements or setup instructions. You just need to use a Windows version supported by Flutter.

For Linux, Amplify depends on the `libsecret` library. To run and debug an app, you need to install `libsecret-1-dev`. You can do this by running the command `sudo apt-get install -y libsecret-1-dev`. When packaging your app with Snapcraft, include the required dependencies in your `snapcraft.yaml` file.

Here is an example of how you might implement the networking permission in Android:
```java
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```
And here is an example of how you might implement the minimum deployment target in iOS using React Native:
```jsx
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  // update the minimum deployment target to 13.0 or higher
}
```
Note that the above code is just an example and may need to be adapted to your specific use case.
