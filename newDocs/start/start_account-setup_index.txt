To configure AWS for local development with Amplify, you need to set up temporary credentials with IAM Identity Center and AWS Organizations. This will enable you to define single-sign-on (SSO), users, groups, permission sets, and more for your team.

If you already have an AWS account and profile configured locally, you don't need to follow this guide. Just add the AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess IAM role to your configured AWS profile.

To set up Identity Center, follow these steps:

1. Create a user with Amplify permissions: Sign in to the AWS Console, enable IAM Identity Center, and create a user with the necessary permissions.
2. Create a password for the user: Reset the password for the user and choose a password.
3. Install the AWS CLI: Download and install the AWS CLI on your local machine.
4. Set up a local AWS profile: Configure an AWS profile that uses the SSO user.
5. Bootstrap your AWS account: Use the AWS profile with AWS Amplify and complete the bootstrapping process.

The bootstrapping process provisions resources for the AWS CDK, including an Amazon S3 bucket and IAM roles. This is a one-time setup that allows you to deploy AWS CDK apps into an AWS environment.

To complete the bootstrapping process, sign in to the AWS Management Console as the account root user or a user with AdministratorAccess permissions. Then, return to the terminal and create a new Amplify sandbox environment using the configured AWS profile.

Here's an example of how to create a user with Amplify permissions using the AWS CLI:
```bash
aws sso-admin create-user --identity-store-id <identity-store-id> --user-name amplify-admin --display-name 'Amplify Admin' --name Formatted=string,FamilyName=Admin,GivenName=Amplify --emails '{"Type":"Work","Value":"<email-address>"}'
```
And here's an example of how to configure an AWS profile that uses the SSO user:
```console
aws configure sso
SSO session name (Recommended): amplify-admin
SSO start URL: <START SESSION URL>
SSO region: <your-region>
SSO registration scopes [sso:account:access]: 
```
Note that you need to replace `<identity-store-id>`, `<email-address>`, `<START SESSION URL>`, and `<your-region>` with the actual values for your AWS account.
