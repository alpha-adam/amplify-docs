To connect your application to AWS resources such as AWS AppSync, Amazon Cognito, Amazon S3, and more, you can use Amplify client libraries. These libraries provide a flexible way to directly connect your application to AWS resources.

To get started, you need to configure the client libraries. This can be done by using the amplify_outputs.json file generated by the Amplify backend tooling. However, using the client libraries does not require backend resources to be created by Amplify.

For JavaScript-based applications, such as React, you can configure the client library by using the generated outputs file or by configuring the library directly by passing a configuration object. For example, to configure the client library for use with Amazon Cognito, you can specify the Auth configuration:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from "aws-amplify"

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    Cognito: {
      userPoolId: "<your-cognito-user-pool-id>",
      userPoolClientId: "<your-cognito-user-pool-client-id>",
      identityPoolId: "<your-cognito-identity-pool-id>",
      loginWith: {
        email: true,
      },
      signUpVerificationMethod: "code",
      userAttributes: {
        email: {
          required: true,
        },
      },
      allowGuestAccess: true,
      passwordFormat: {
        minLength: 8,
        requireLowercase: true,
        requireUppercase: true,
        requireNumbers: true,
        requireSpecialCharacters: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

By configuring the client library, Amplify automates the communication with the underlying AWS resources, and provides a friendly API to author your business logic. For example, you can use the signIn function to initiate the sign-in flow without passing information from your Cognito resource:

```javascript
import { signIn } from "aws-amplify/auth"

await signIn({
  username: "john.doe@example.com",
  password: "hunter2",
})
```
